# Intro

With an innate love of writing code to solve complex issues, I have been programming since age of fifteen. I taught myself to code through reading books and stackoverflow, online tutorials, and managed to develop some online application, linux cli tools with experience in data structures and algorithms. I have allowed myself to reach a good level in the field of cybersec. I am fluent in variety of computer lannguages. I am currently finishing my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communications and hopes to intern in an software development company.
