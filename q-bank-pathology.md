## Short Questions (3-5 sentences each)

### 1. What is acute inflammation?
**Answer:** Acute inflammation is a rapid-onset, short-duration inflammatory response to tissue injury or infection, typically lasting minutes to days. It is characterized by five cardinal signs: redness (rubor), heat (calor), swelling (tumor), pain (dolor), and loss of function (functio laesa). The process involves vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and recruitment of immune cells, particularly neutrophils. The purpose is to eliminate harmful stimuli, remove damaged tissue, and initiate tissue repair.

### 2. What is wound healing? Mention its types.
**Answer:** Wound healing is the complex biological process by which damaged tissue is repaired and restored to normal function. It occurs in three overlapping phases: inflammation, proliferation (tissue formation), and remodeling (maturation). There are two main types: **Primary healing** (healing by first intention) occurs when wound edges are closely approximated with minimal tissue loss, resulting in minimal scarring. **Secondary healing** (healing by second intention) occurs in wounds with significant tissue loss, involving granulation tissue formation and more extensive scarring.

### 3. What is edema? Write two causes.
**Answer:** Edema is the abnormal accumulation of interstitial fluid in tissues, resulting in visible swelling. It occurs when the balance between fluid filtration and reabsorption is disrupted. **Two major causes are:** 1) **Heart failure** - reduced cardiac output leads to fluid retention and venous congestion. 2) **Hypoproteinemia** - low plasma protein levels (especially albumin) reduce oncotic pressure, allowing fluid to leak into tissues.

### 4. What is anemia? Write two symptoms.
**Answer:** Anemia is a condition where the blood has insufficient red blood cells or hemoglobin to carry adequate oxygen to body tissues. It can result from decreased production, increased destruction, or blood loss. **Two common symptoms are:** 1) **Fatigue and weakness** - due to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues. 2) **Pallor** - pale skin, mucous membranes, and nail beds due to decreased red blood cell count.

### 5. What is necrosis? Name any two types.
**Answer:** Necrosis is the pathological death of cells or tissues in living organisms due to disease, injury, or lack of blood supply. It is characterized by irreversible loss of cellular function and structural integrity. **Two main types are:** 1) **Coagulative necrosis** - most common type where cell architecture is preserved initially, commonly seen in ischemic conditions. 2) **Liquefactive necrosis** - tissue becomes liquefied due to enzyme action, commonly seen in brain infarcts and bacterial infections.

### 6. What is jaundice? Write its types.
**Answer:** Jaundice is the yellow discoloration of skin, sclera, and mucous membranes due to elevated bilirubin levels in blood (hyperbilirubinemia). **Three main types based on cause:** 1) **Prehepatic jaundice** - due to excessive hemolysis of red blood cells. 2) **Hepatic jaundice** - due to liver cell damage or dysfunction. 3) **Posthepatic jaundice** - due to obstruction of bile flow from liver to intestine.

### 7. What is immunity? Give two examples.
**Answer:** Immunity is the body's defense mechanism against foreign substances, pathogens, and abnormal cells. It can be innate (natural, non-specific) or adaptive (acquired, specific). **Two examples are:** 1) **Active immunity** - body produces its own antibodies after exposure to antigen (e.g., vaccination or natural infection). 2) **Passive immunity** - temporary immunity gained by receiving antibodies from another source (e.g., maternal antibodies through breast milk).

### 8. What are benign tumors? Write two features.
**Answer:** Benign tumors are non-cancerous growths that do not spread to other parts of the body and generally grow slowly. **Two key features are:** 1) **Well-defined borders** - they have clear boundaries and do not invade surrounding tissues. 2) **No metastasis** - they do not spread to distant organs or tissues through blood or lymphatic systems.

### 9. What is pus formation?
**Answer:** Pus formation (suppuration) is the production of a thick, opaque fluid during bacterial infections as part of the acute inflammatory response. It consists of dead neutrophils, bacteria, tissue debris, and inflammatory exudate. The process occurs when neutrophils migrate to the infection site, engulf bacteria, and die in the process, creating the characteristic yellow-white appearance of pus.

### 10. Explain briefly: shock.
**Answer:** Shock is a life-threatening circulatory failure resulting in inadequate tissue perfusion and cellular hypoxia. It can be caused by various mechanisms: hypovolemic (blood/fluid loss), cardiogenic (heart failure), distributive (vasodilation), or obstructive (impaired venous return). Clinical signs include hypotension, tachycardia, altered mental state, and poor peripheral perfusion. Without prompt treatment, shock leads to multiple organ failure and death.

### 11. What is cell adaptation? Give two examples.
**Answer:** Cell adaptation refers to reversible changes in cell size, number, or function in response to environmental stress or altered physiological demands. These changes help cells survive and maintain function under adverse conditions. **Two examples are:** 1) **Hypertrophy** - increase in cell size (e.g., cardiac muscle enlargement in hypertension). 2) **Atrophy** - decrease in cell size and number (e.g., muscle wasting from disuse).

## Long Questions (Detailed explanations)

### 1. Describe the process of wound healing.
**Answer:** 
Wound healing is a complex, coordinated process involving multiple cell types, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components. It occurs in three overlapping phases:

**Phase 1: Inflammatory Phase (0-3 days)**
- Immediate vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation
- Platelet aggregation and clot formation (hemostasis)
- Neutrophil infiltration to remove bacteria and debris
- Macrophage recruitment for continued debris removal and growth factor release

**Phase 2: Proliferative Phase (3-21 days)**
- Angiogenesis: formation of new blood vessels
- Fibroplasia: fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis
- Granulation tissue formation
- Epithelialization: epithelial cell migration and proliferation to close the wound
- Wound contraction by myofibroblasts

**Phase 3: Remodeling Phase (21 days-1 year)**
- Collagen reorganization and cross-linking
- Gradual increase in tensile strength
- Reduction in cell number and vascularity
- Final scar formation

The process can heal by primary intention (minimal tissue loss) or secondary intention (significant tissue loss requiring more extensive repair).
